### Project
**Project:** ML-Based Stroke Risk Prediction

**Objective:**
Perform a Logistic Regression  on the Patients' health from the Dataset within 13 attributes of their health conditions to uncover insights into whether patients can get a heart attack and future enhancement with a Static UI.

## Technologies

- VS Code
- Numpy
- Pandas
- train_test_split
- Logistic Regression
- Accuracy Score
- Warnings
- HTML
- JS
- CSS

## Key Activities
# Heart Disease Prediction System
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Load and clean the dataset.
- Handle missing values and perform data imputation.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Select relevant attributes for heart disease prediction.
- Normalize and preprocess input data.

### 3. Machine Learning Model Implementation
- Train logistic regression and other models.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 4. User Interface (UI) Development
- Create a static webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Design an input form where users enter `0` or `1` for each health factor.

### 5. Prediction Logic in Frontend
- Implement JavaScript logic to classify user input.
- Display prediction results dynamically on the webpage.

### 6. Integration & Deployment
- Ensure smooth interaction between UI and predictive logic.
- Prepare for GitHub repository upload and future enhancements.

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Enter `0` or `1` for each health factor.
4. Click "Predict" to see the results.
